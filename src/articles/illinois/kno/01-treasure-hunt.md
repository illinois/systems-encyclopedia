# Keep Nearding Out - KNO#1

In lecture on Tuesday, you learned about a number of data storage systems -- including object storage like AWS S3.  As part of the lecture, I promised a treasure hunt for you to explore using S3 yourself and it's ready to go!

Complete this to earn +1 EC.


## Treasure Hunt Details

 have uploaded a file just for you in an AWS S3 bucket!  Go find it! :)

- The name of the file is the SHA-256 hash of your NetID, with a `.txt` extension added to the end of the hash.

- I only used lowercase letters (in both your NetID and the SHA-256 hash).

- Use Python and S3 APIs to access the file.  The bucket name is `waf-uiuc-cs340` and the file is publicly accessible (no auth needed, but I have disabled listing all files, so you have to know the name of the file).

We will go over more S3 code in lecture on Thursday to help you out.
