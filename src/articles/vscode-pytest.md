# Guide to setup pytest debugger for VS Code

- Install the Python extension for VS Code
- From your project directory, open the command palette with `<CTRL-SHIFT-P>` (Windows) or `<CMD-SHIFT-P>` (Mac)
- Choose "Python: Configure Tests" > "pytest" > "." (root directory)
- You should see a new icon in the sidebar called "Testing". Open this to find the debug and run button (in green).
- You can add breakpoints in both the test file and your app.py file.
